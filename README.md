**QM40 is a QMx type of dataset which includes 150K molecules optimized from B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory in the Gaussian16 with QM parameters, optimized coordinates, Mulliken charges and Local 
vibrational mode parameters as a quantitative measurer of the bond strengths. These 150,000 molecules have been chosen to represent the real chemical space of drug-like compounds. The molecules have a 
maximum heavy atom count of up to 40 and can contain the following atoms: Carbon (C), Fluorine (F), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Sulfur (S), and Chlorine (Cl).**
